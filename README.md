## The Story

---

My girlfriend and I are starting a family, a plant family actually. So, I figured this would be the perfect opportunity to stretch my brain and hone skills across both ends of web development. GreenLog is our plant tracking progressive web app focused on making it easier to keep track of the love and care put into our little friends. The stack is an interesting mix of tech that I'm particularly interested in.
